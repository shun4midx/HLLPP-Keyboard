## Description
The HLLPP (HyperLogLog++) keyboard is an Android keyboard, that uses the efficient and minimal memory usage [HLLPP Autocorrection](https://github.com/shun4midx/HyperLogLogPlusPlus-Autocorrect) algorithm, which [Shun](https://github.com/shun4midx) took part in creating to become a reality. Its main data structure is inspired by the cardinality estimator "HyperLogLog++". More specifically, it uses certain properties of HLL++'s bit registers to detect frequencies of qgrams, to estimate cardinality, in order to better autocorrect words. It is a successor of the legacy project [FQ-HLL Keyboard](https://github.com/shun4midx/FQ-HLL-Keyboard), which eases the switch to HLLPP Keyboard.

### Motivation and Details
In 2025, Shun's fascination over algorithms has inspired the [FQ-HLL (Frequency-Quantized HyperLogLog) Autocorrection](https://github.com/shun4midx/FQ-HyperLogLog-Autocorrect) algorithm, since HLL is rarely used in the context of autocorrection, which he and [Ducky](https://github.com/ducky4life) turned into the FQ-HLL Keyboard. After only using the FQ-HLL Keyboard on his phone for a year, he has noticed some minor qualitative stylistic flaws with FQ-HLL's prioritization ranking suggestions. Thus, in the summer of 2026, he developed the HLLPP Autocorrection algorithm in order to resolve these issues, and also to test out HLL++ under sparse conditions.

Created by Shun, who is dyslexic, the HLLPP Autocorrection aims to be a close depiction of how he reads as a dyslexic person. He has struggled for years never finding a fitting mobile keyboard for him, since autocorrection even by top companies rarely accounted for dyslexics, and oftentimes his typos would not be corrected. However, upon using the FQ-HLL Keyboard and now the HLLPP Keyboard, this frustration has suddenly vanished, and he did not require as much brainpower anymore to type with this keyboard due to the more dyslexia-friendly autocorrection suggestions, such as "klof" -> "folk".

Thus, here we present the HLLPP keyboard, which is made for everyone but especially dyslexic people in mind, with an autocorrection algorithm that hopefully eases common frustrations with autocorrection. HLLPP does not require knowledge of any particular language, requiring only a dictionary to achieve high accuracy, which makes it perfect for multilingual users. The ability to have custom dictionaries appended to the current English dictionary is already supported!

## Installation

Download the latest release of the app [here](https://github.com/shun4midx/HLLPP-Keyboard/releases/latest), install the apk and head to your phone's keyboard settings. Enable `HLLPP Keyboard` and switch to the keyboard.

The latest (development) release build of the app can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/shun4midx/HLLPP-Keyboard/blob/main/app/release/app-release.apk). This is the most up-to-date version and is recommended unless a version of the app is released recently.

You can also launch system keyboard settings and switch keyboards from the installed app.

Keyboard settings can be found by launching the HLLPP Keyboard app installed with the apk, or by pressing the `⎋` button on the keyboard/holding down enter key in zhuyin keyboard.

Keyboard settings are saved across updates of the app.

## Usage

#### Importing and Exporting English Dictionary

The import/export functions can be accessed through the HLLPP Keyboard App installed with the apk.

#### Suggestion Bar

The bolded word will autoreplace your typed word (user-word) if you hit space.

When there is a bolded suggestion, the first suggestion to the left is the user-word. You can long press the user-word to add it to dictionary, or long press a suggestion to remove the suggestion from dictionary.

If the suggestion is wrong, you can long press enter to skip the replacement.

More suggestions can be accessed in Chinese keyboard layouts by tapping the clipboard button.

When there are no suggestions, long pressing the enter key enters password mode, where your inputs are not displayed on the suggestion bar.

You can long press the text editor button to change languages.

#### Main Keyboard

| Key | Long Press function |
|-----|---------------------|
| comma `,` | select all |
| full stop `.` | delete last word |
| symbols `!?#` | numpad |
| enter `↵` | skip replacement/password mode |
| clipboard `⎘` | super/subscript mode |
| text editor `𝙸` | change languages |
| caps lock `Caps` | copy selected/paste last copied |

#### Super/Subscript Keyboard/Mathbb Keyboard

Access the Super/Subscript keyboard by long pressing clipboard in the main keyboard. You can long press a superscripted character to type its subscripted version, and long press `.` to type a fancy fraction symbol.

The Caps key toggles between the mathbb keyboard and the super/subscript keyboard when using one of them.

#### Symbols

There are two pages in the symbol keyboard, with the first being regular symbols, and the second being math symbols.

Chinese symbols are available in the symbol keyboard when typing in Chinese, and can also be typed by long pressing symbols in the symbol keyboard in English mode.

More symbols can be accessed by holding down a symbol on either page.

##### Symbol Layouts

###### Default (similar to Samsung keyboard layout)

<img width="400" alt="symbol_layout_main" src="./images/default_symbol.png" />

###### Alternative (similar to Gboard layout)

<img width="400" alt="symbol_layout_alternative" src="./images/alternative_symbol.png" />

###### Math ([Space Cadet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard) layout)

<img width="400" alt="symbol_layout_math" src="./images/math_symbol.png" />

#### Zhuyin
We now support traditional Chinese typing via Zhuyin, with both the normal Zhuyin layout and an alternate Eten layout! It supports fuzzy Zhuyin typing (i.e. there is no need for 100% accuracy with typing), and selection based on common phrases instead of word-by-word. However, as of right now, you would need to type the Zhuyin  **with the tone of the word**. The first tone is parsed as a "whitespace". We referenced `tsi.json` from [`dylandy/tobopomo.js`](https://github.com/dylandy/tobopomo.js/tree/master/data/tsi.json), with the addition of the words 啲 (ㄉㄧ), 喺 (ㄒㄧˋ, ㄒㄧˊ), 佢 (ㄑㄩˊ), 㗎 (ㄐㄧㄚˋ), 嚟 (ㄌㄧˊ), 哋 (ㄉㄧˋ), 咗 (ㄗㄨㄛˇ), 俾 (ㄅㄟ), 嗰 (ㄍㄜˇ), 嘢 (ㄧㄝˇ), and many other words which are common in Cantonese speech. The addition of these words made us name it `tsi_custom.json`, which can be found [here](https://github.com/shun4midx/HLLPP-Keyboard/blob/main/app/src/main/data/tsi_custom.json). 

We also rank fuzzy suggestions, displayed after all correct suggestions, with single-character Chinese suggestions using character frequency as one of the ranking signals, based on a [source](https://teric.naer.edu.tw/wSite/ct?ctNode=645&mp=teric_b&xItem=2068770&resCtNode=453) from the Taiwan Education Resources Information Center, detailing Chinese character frequency in Taiwan in 2023. It is downloaded from `附件下載1` on the linked page, and the raw file can be accessed [here](https://github.com/shun4midx/HLLPP-Keyboard/blob/main/app/src/main/data/附錄1、民國112年語料字頻表.xlsx). From the same website, we also download `附件下載2`, but the raw file is too large to push (roughly 1.0GB). It is a file detailing Chinese word (詞語) frequency, and we use it to rank Chinese words according to frequency.

##### Zhuyin Keyboard

Individual Zhuyin characters can be typed by long pressing the respective key.

More suggestions can be accessed by tapping the clipboard button.

Chinese symbols are available in the symbol keyboard when typing in Chinese, and can also be typed by long pressing symbols in the symbol keyboard in English mode.

#### Pinyin

We also support a preliminary version of Pinyin typing under the same traditional Chinese dictionary. It currently does not support fuzzy typing, and requires the user to **type a whitespace at the end of each syllable**, to be able to parse the corresponding characters correctly. After the syllable, the user can type a number (0~4) to indicate the tone of the character, before the whitespace. However, tones are optional for Pinyin.

Similar to Zhuyin, for toneless Pinyin input, single-character Chinese suggestions from different tone variants are interleaved and ranked using the same character-frequency source. We also rank Chinese words according to frequency like in Zhuyin.

##### Pinyin Keyboard

Individual Pinyin (alphabetical) characters can be typed by long pressing the respective key.

More suggestions can be accessed by tapping the clipboard button.

Tones can be inputted at the end of a word by appending the tone (`0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`) at the end of each word.

Multiple words can be typed at once if they are separated by spaces.

#### Clipboard

The clipboard displays copied text. You can paste an item by clicking on its box.

You can copy/paste by using the android copy/paste system, long pressing Caps to copy (if selected text) or paste (if no selected text) the last item in the clipboard, or using the text editor.

The paste function supports pasting images, but images are not stored in the clipboard.

You can delete an item by long pressing its box, or long press the clipboard button to clear the entire clipboard.

#### Numpad

You can access the numpad by long pressing symbols, or through the emoji keyboard.

There is a built-in calculator that can be accessed by typing `==` on the numpad/symbol keyboard, or hitting the enter key on the numpad after an expression to evaluate it.

To enter a newline on the numpad, long press the enter key.

#### Text Editor

- grid mode (left), maximize mode (right)

## Customisation

### Keyboard height

You can build a custom apk using github actions with the keyboard height of your choice. The built apk will be exported as the workflow run artifact. Use the example workflow below or [fork this repository](https://github.com/shun4midx/HLLPP-Keyboard/fork) and run [trigger_custom_apk.yml](https://github.com/shun4midx/HLLPP-Keyboard/blob/main/.github/workflows/trigger_custom_apk.yml).

Choose the "Custom" keyboard height in settings to use it. Note that the built apk is a debug apk and is not signed unlike the official releases.

[example workflow](https://github.com/shun4midx/HLLPP-Keyboard/blob/main/.github/workflows/trigger_custom_apk.yml):
```yml
name: Build custom HLLPP Keyboard apk

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:

    uses: shun4midx/HLLPP-Keyboard/.github/workflows/build_custom_apk.yml@main
    with:
      # in dp; default main keyboard heights are short: 45, medium: 50, tall: 60
      keyboard-height: 50
```

### Themes

You can view the themes in the [themes folder](https://github.com/shun4midx/HLLPP-Keyboard/tree/main/themes#readme).

Want a custom theme? Customisable themes may be implemented in the future, but until then you can open an issue to request one. Please include hex codes of key colour, key text colour, key pressed colour, key border colour, keyboard background colour, suggestion bar colour, and suggestion bar text colour. Alternatively, fork the repository, edit themes.xml, and either build your own apk or open a pull request.

## Development usage

Install android studio and run the app. The usage after installation is the same as [installing from apk](https://github.com/shun4midx/HLLPP-Keyboard?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
